Software Time Log

Shift registers, addrbus implementation, testbench

timings
100 MHz clk is 10 ns full cycle

t_w Pulse Duration

CLK high or low = 7ns , means use 50 MHz to drive LV165
SH/LD low 7.5 or 9 ns - same condition

Setup time
SH/LD high before CLK^ 8 ns - SH/LD rise for 1 low CLK

use bank flags
figure why obtain address takes 180ns in tb, but 360 in memory_interface? state 1 => 2

[2] Thursday 3/29/18
2115-2315 studying if cru meets timing constraints. cru_interface. obtain address on every negedge phi3 in memory_interface. cru_read_gen, cru_write_gen


FD1771 FDSEL*:
MBE active, A3,4,5,6,12 high
$5Exx8   four registers
$5Fxx8
FDSEL* also enters NAND with HI ROM CS1* (the rom at $5000)

1800-1900 preparing memory mapped device interface

[4] Sunday 4/1/18
2000-2400 implement SN76489 (x4 for FORTi)

[1] Monday 4/2/18
Move sound enable out of memory_interface. Try to make data_bus internally usable (for gram etc) by enforcing tri-state.
