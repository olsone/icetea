IceTea

IceTea is an open platform for sidecar expansion of the TI-99/4A.

In its standard configuration, it gives you expansion memory (32k or 512K SAMS extended memory),
an SD card slot, a 12-voice sound generator with sampled sounds, and space to load
your own peripheral "cards" using standard PMOD headers, DSR RAM and FPGA fabric.

IceTea is based on circuits coded precisely in FPGA, not software emulation. 

IceTea can be re-configured by connecting to its USB port, using free software running on
platforms including Raspberry Pi, Mac OS X, Windows, or any Linux flavor.

Basic Features

SD card storage.  Your card can contain CF7-style raw disk volumes, or a FAT32 file system with 
a mixture of V9T9 DSK images and TI-files-as-directories (FIAD) just like you would use in
Classic99.
A ROM cartridge library via SD (sorry no GROM.)
32k RAM (optional if you use a 32k sidecar already)
SAMS memory in the unused part of the 512K.
Compatibility with TIPI. You can use TIPI to rebuild all the software for IceTea.
Open source. All of IceTea, including the hardware and tools required to remake it, is free and open.
  (Some tools are KiCad, IceStorm, Yosys, Arachne, gforth, swapFORTH, Mecrisp, OSH BlackIce and SweetTea boards, and others.)

Users Who Will Benefit
======================

Basic: IceTea can be a complete sidecar expansion for the 99/4A for about $99, but still plays nice with FinalGROM and TiPi.
It supports all programs for the 99/4A that require common expansion peripherals.

Tinkerer: IceTea is a perfect platform to experiment with wiring up hardware. You can begin with a breadboard and TI BASIC.

Expert: IceTea is a great platform to begin learning FPGA programming on the HX8K. The BlackIce board is capable of simulating
common microcomputers--maybe even a whole 4A core someday. It has an upgrade path to larger FPGAs. 

FORTH Fan: IceTea comes with an FORTH cpu core, enabling some really cool interactions with TI FORTH. 9900 assembly
can call FORTH subroutines on IceTea. (In fact the disk system is written this way.)


Further expansion

PMOD is a simple connector for attaching hardware. IceTea leaves 3 double PMOD connectors in the front
and 2 single PMOD connectors in the back. A great many plug in modules are available from
Digilent and others such as: 

Buttons, switches, joystick
Digital-to-Analog outputs
Light, temperature, humidity, barometer, range
Stepper, H-bridge, and Servo control
Digital compass, accelerometer
Tiny color screens, 7-segment numerals


For instance, adding a stepper motor peripheral:

1. Obtain Digilent STEP PMOD for $18. Attach one or two stepper motors.
2. Take the GPIO example code for a raw parallel port. Assign it to a CRU base address, or a CPU memory address.
Decide how much RAM to reserve for the device.
3. Write 9900 assembly to poke values into the PMOD by either CRU or CPU memory access.
4. Once you have tested these, you can add more layers of software in the form of a DSR. 

The parallel port example can be controlled with CALL LOAD in Basic or Extended Basic.
Example code is also provided in FORTH.

A DSR could provide subprograms to BASIC for linear or circular motion control.


Use IceTea to augment games with new sound and physical effects. 

Example code shows how to detect when a game is playing a certain sound effect.
You could set it to trigger a different sound list, or to control external light and vibration.

The sky really is the limit with IceTea.


=====
FORTH
=====

IceTea comes with its own FORTH language built in.

A program in TI-99/4A memory can call into the IceTea to run programs on its FORTH processor
and modify data in shared memory. 

For one thing, the SD card driver and FAT32 file system are written in FORTH. Thus, a native
disk DSR in 4A space gives commands to the FORTH system to read and write blocks or files.
The SD card can contain CF7-style raw disk volumes, or a FAT32 file system with 
a mixture of V9T9 DSK images and TI-files-as-directories (FIAD) just like you would use in
Classic99.

Drivers in FORTH can be developed and debugged interactively by connecting directly to the
FORTH prompt. They can be modified and tested without restarting the system.

Interface design
================

IceTea uses the memory-mapped I/O space of the TI sound chip at 8400 - 87ff. It is recommended
to disconnect the  sound output of the 4A.
